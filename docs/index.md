Notehax is a 3ds userland exploit for Flipnote Studio 3D, allowing one to launch
[the Homebrew Launcher](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) through the game.
## Requirements
You'll need :  
* a 3ds on firmware <= 11.4
* a digital copy of [Flipnote Studio 3D](https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/)

## Installation
1. Get the [notehax archive](https://github.com/notehax/releases/) according to your region.
2. Extract it to the root of your SD card (the /private folder must be at the root) /!\ If you delete the previous /private folder all your notes saved on the SD card will be lost /!\
3. Download the [otherapp payload](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) corresponding to your region/console/firmware etc.
4. Copy the otherapp payload to the /notehax folder and rename it "otherapp.bin".

## How to use notehax
To access [the Homebrew Launcher](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) just try to open the custom note that should've appeared in the SD folder:
